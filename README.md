This project is based on the classic **Simon Says** game, implemented from scratch using **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**. The goal of the game is to repeat a growing sequence of colors and sounds.

This project was created as part of a **freeCodeCamp** challenge.

## 🎮 How it works

- The game shows a sequence of buttons (with colors and sounds).
- The player must repeat the sequence by pressing the buttons in the same order.
- With each correct step, a new one is added to the sequence.
- If you reach **step 20**, you win the game.
- If you make an error, there are two game modes:

## 🧠 Game Modes

### 🔁 Normal Mode
- If you make a mistake, the sequence repeats from the beginning.
- You do not lose the progress you've accumulated.

### 🔒 Strict Mode
- If you make a mistake, the game restarts completely with a **new random sequence**.
- You start from step 1.

## 🧩 Technologies Used

- **HTML5** for structure.
- **CSS3** with animations for visual effects.
- **JavaScript** for game logic, sequence control, events, audio, and asynchrony.
